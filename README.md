## Project Description:
The Calorie Tracker is a web-based application that helps users track their daily calorie intake by adding meals, either by searching local food items or manually entering meal details. This also allows for a bar code scanning feature. The app provides calorie data and helps users manage their diet efficiently.

## Problem Statement:
Tracking daily calorie intake can be challenging for individuals trying to manage their health and fitness. Existing calorie trackers often lack the support for local foods, which makes it difficult for users in Kerala (and similar regions) to track meals accurately.

## Solution:
This application allows users to input food items either manually or through a barcode scan, supports both local foods and general meals, and calculates total calorie intake. It also offers features like meal categorization (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks) and stores meal data locally for later use.

## Technical Details:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Data Storage**: Local Storage (browser-based)
- **API**: USDA Food Database API for fetching calorie information and Open Food Facts API for barcode 

## Technologies and Components Used:
**Software:**
- **HTML5**: For creating the structure and layout of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling, including background gradients, buttons, and form elements.
- **JavaScript**: For handling user interactions (e.g., meal search, barcode scanning, and storing meal data).
- **Local Storage**: To store the total calorie count and meal history locally in the browser.
- **USDA API**: To fetch food details and calories for foods not available in the local dataset.
- **Barcode Scanner**: For scanning food barcodes to get data automatically.
  **Hardware:**
-**Laptop**: For coding purposes.

## Implementation:
1. **Food Search**: The search bar allows users to search for food items by name. Local food items and their calorie values are displayed based on the search query.
2. **Meal Type Selection**: Users can categorize the meal as Breakfast, Lunch, Snacks, or Dinner.
3. **Manual Meal Entry**: Users can manually enter food details such as name and calories if the food is not found in the search.
4. **Barcode Scanning (Optional)**: Users can scan food barcodes to fetch and enter meal data automatically.
